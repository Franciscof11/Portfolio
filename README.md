   <h2>About 📖</h2>
   
   <p>
    I rebuilt my Portfolio Web using #FlutterWeb and specific animation libraries from PubDev. I made this project to understand what level Flutter Web is at, and if it is viable or not to use it. It's a new and different way of working with #Flutter and #Dart.
OBS: Responsive for mobile is still under construction due to waiting for updates for Flutter 4.

   Learnings 🤯
   </h2>

  In this project I had to study more deeply how flutter works in the web part, and about responsiveness. I also studied state management for the web and flutter web animations.
