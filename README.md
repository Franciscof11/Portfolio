   <h2>About 📖</h2>
   
   <p>
    I rebuilt my Portfolio Web using #FlutterWeb and specific animation libraries from PubDev. I made this project to understand what level Flutter Web is at, and if it is viable or not to use it. It's a new and different way of working with #Flutter and #Dart.
OBS: Responsive for mobile is still under construction due to waiting for updates for Flutter 4.

 <h2>
   Learnings 🤯
   </h2>
The development of this application made me study more deeply about api requests in flutter.animations and state management with GetX package.
It also forced me to study more about client http , using the DIO package. I learned how to handle connection errors when querying the api.
